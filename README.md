# Text-generation-with-GPT-2

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune OpenAIâ€™s GPT-2 model to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on custom training data. Using the transformer-based architecture of GPT-2, the model is trained to mimic the style, tone, and structure of the input dataset. The process includes data preprocessing, model fine-tuning, and generating sample outputs. This project is ideal for learning how to adapt pre-trained language models for specialized tasks like creative writing, customer service bots, or domain-specific content generation.
